# Screensaver Inhibitor

A PHP script to list the current screensaver inhibitors.

The script queries the DBus system for processes that are currently running and preventing your screensaver from kicking in.

* Why do I want that?

    When I go to bed, I like to lock my screen, only in the morning at times it's on. That's becomes a process (often Firefox) has an inhibitor in effect. The idea of the script is to find out which that is and close that tab or tool for the night.
